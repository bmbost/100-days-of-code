# 100 Days Of Code - Log (from newest to oldest)

### Day 15: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Skipped yesterday (zzzz again), and had to make today a minimal day of coding as I wasn't at home for most of it. However, I got my time in here at the last moment. Completed the JSON APIs and Ajax section of freeCodeCamp. Now I'm up to the first Intermediate front-end developer projects, Build a Random Quote Machine. Looks like fun.

**Thoughts:** Need more sleep.

### Day 14: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the last three challenges on freeCodeCamp's algorithm section.

**Thoughts:** I should not be sacrificing sleep as much as I am. It's why I skipped yesterday; was just too tired to code. But now I have a goal completed! On to JSON APIs and Ajax!

### Day 13: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed one challenge. Just one. the "Falsy Bouncer" algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to complete the four algorithm challenges I had left. But I had no time left after trying my hand at that one. And to think the solution was so simple, after reading over and over on what exactly .filter() did and seeing examples of how others used it in YouTube videos. I finally found the place in the docs where it said it would only send back variables that were true, and then it dawned on me: all the ones I'm trying to filter out are by definition false, so they will never be picked up by filter anyway. So, there it was. Took several hours to figure that one out.

### Day 12: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed three more challenges, only 4 to go.

**Thoughts:** Had several snags, especially on the Chunky Monkey and the Mutations challenge. But, I got them to complete.

### Day 11: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Skipped yesterday because I was falling asleep at the keyboard. :-/ Completed three more algorithm challenges on freeCodeCamp, and only have 7 more to go.

**Thoughts:** These challenges can be hard, but so far I've been working through them like a champ. Just haven't been able to spend a lot of time on working on them, only a couple of hours a night.

### Day 10: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed two more of the algorithm challenges in freeCodeCamp, the Palindrome challenge and the longest word challenge. Worked on the "Title Case a Sentence" challenge but couldn't get it completed in time. EDIT (while writing no less): completed the "Title Case a Sentence" challenge.

**Thoughts:** Regular expressions are weird to me and are going to take some getting used to. Also, the title case a sentence challenge is bugging me. I think I've got the gist of what I need to do to make it work, but my code is not cooperating. The way I understand it, if it works this way, is I will need to split the sentence into an array of words, then split each word into an array of characters---wait, I think I figured out my problem. (tests) Yes, I did. One more challenge completed. :-)

### Day 9: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the "Basic JavaScript" section of freeCodeCamp, as well as the "Object Oriented and Functional Programming" section. Started on the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" section, completing the Reverse a String and Factorialize a Number challenge.

**Thoughts:** I sprinted through everything pretty quickly, and even knocked out the reverse a string challenge on the quick side. However, I had an issue with the factorialization problem. I originally wrote it as a recursive function call, which worked perfect. However, none of freeCodeCamp up to this point has went over recursion. So, I went back to do it again as a loop. Tried a for loop, but it would not work. Tried a while loop. Still wouldn't work. I was trying to count down from the parameter sent to the function down to 1. I had to reverse it to get the loop to work. 

After that, I decided to post in the forum to see what my issue was to make it not even look at the loop when traversing one way, and be fine the other. It was while I was typing out the code that I realized: I had the comparison backwards, meaning it was always going to say the loop was not applicable. /doh /facepalm

### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Almost finished the JavaScript portion of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't get as much done as I wanted because I'm too tired and need sleep. Only 7 more challenges though and I'll be on to the next section!

### Day 7: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed my 200th freeCodeCamp challenge, well into the JavaScript section and almost have it completed.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to fly through the practices, while still pick up the details. I just hope it's sinking in.

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I spent a lot of the day working on the portfolio project for freeCodeCamp. Took a while, but managed to complete it satisfying all of the user stories! I also got a good chunk into the JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I wouldn't say the portfolio is my best piece of work, but I like was I was able to do so far. And I can't wait to dive into JavaScript. I still got a lot to go in that section, though. Will see what the morrow may bring!

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Tribute page! Managed to find a Nintendo logo I could use that was under public domain, then wrote the code and added a timeline in an unordered list as well as a link to the Wikipedia page for Nintendo.

**Thoughts:** Went very well, although the only issue I had was the unordered list itself. I would have really liked to be able to center the list itself on the page, but not center the text (by that I mean, the list as a whole was center, but the text of each item in the list still aligned left with the dot). Couldn't figure out a way to do it, and just left it because it did make it work well on smaller, mobile screens. Tried to mess with padding, which worked, but made it horrible on mobile.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Tribute project for freeCodeCamp. Picked the topic of making a small tribute page to Nintendo. Hopefully will complete it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Finding Creative Commons pictures for high-profile companies like Nintendo isn't easy.

**Link to Work:** Have it saved locally for now, will upload to CodePen and Github tomorrow.


### Day 3: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the jQuery section of freeCodeCamp, and now I'm to start the first challenge: build a tribute page on CodePen! Sadly, I don't have the time to actually start the challenge tonight, but will work on it first chance tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I already have some ideas in my head for what to base it on. Knowing me, I'll probably make it video game related, although I may base it on something else. A programming language, perhaps? There are many things I could pay tribute to in making a tribute page.

**Link to work:** Completed the "jQuery" section of freeCodeCamp. Signed up for CodePen. Will have link to pen that my tribute page is being worked on tomorrow.


### Day 2: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the "Responsive Design with Bootstrap" section of the Front End Development Certification track as well as the "Gear Up for Success" section and three exercises into the "jQuery" section.

**Thoughts:** Completed those sections faster than I thought I would. Also managed to surpass 100 exercises already.

**Link to Work:** Completed up to "Target Elements by ID using jQuery" exercise on freeCodeCamp.


### Day 1: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** After having started and stopped the FreeCodeCamp.com first few exercises for the past several months, I decided to sit down and drill out as much as I can, every day, until the 100 days are complete or until I have completed all of the FreeCodeCamp.com site content. If I complete it before the 100 days are up, I will begin to work on a project that I have in my heart that I've wanted to work towards.

**Thoughts:** While I had gotten about halfway through the first section on HTML and CSS over the past several months, by sitting down and spending several hours on it at a time instead of picking at it, I completed the section last night. It felt good to have the refresher, as I hadn't done any work in HTML5 and CSS since it was HTML3/4 and CSS1.

**Link to Work:** I'll be honest, I'm not sure how to link to work for the sections leading up to a project in FreeCodeCamp.com. I completed the full HTML5 and CSS section of the Front End Development Certification track.
