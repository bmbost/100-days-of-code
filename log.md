# 100 Days Of Code - Log (from newest to oldest)

### Day 3: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the jQuery section of freeCodeCamp, and now I'm to start the first challenge: build a tribute page on CodePen! Sadly, I don't have the time to actually start the challenge tonight, but will work on it first chance tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I already have some ideas in my head for what to base it on. Knowing me, I'll probably make it video game related, although I may base it on something else. A programming language, perhaps? There are many things I could pay tribute to in making a tribute page.

**Link to work:** Completed the "jQuery" section of freeCodeCamp. Signed up for CodePen. Will have link to pen that my tribute page is being worked on tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the "Responsive Design with Bootstrap" section of the Front End Development Certification track as well as the "Gear Up for Success" section and three exercises into the "jQuery" section.

**Thoughts:** Completed those sections faster than I thought I would. Also managed to surpass 100 exercises already.

**Link to Work:** Completed up to "Target Elements by ID using jQuery" exercise on freeCodeCamp.


### Day 1: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** After having started and stopped the FreeCodeCamp.com first few exercises for the past several months, I decided to sit down and drill out as much as I can, every day, until the 100 days are complete or until I have completed all of the FreeCodeCamp.com site content. If I complete it before the 100 days are up, I will begin to work on a project that I have in my heart that I've wanted to work towards.

**Thoughts:** While I had gotten about halfway through the first section on HTML and CSS over the past several months, by sitting down and spending several hours on it at a time instead of picking at it, I completed the section last night. It felt good to have the refresher, as I hadn't done any work in HTML5 and CSS since it was HTML3/4 and CSS1.

**Link to Work:** I'll be honest, I'm not sure how to link to work for the sections leading up to a project in FreeCodeCamp.com. I completed the full HTML5 and CSS section of the Front End Development Certification track.
